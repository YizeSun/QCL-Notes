# Build Quantum Computer
[toc]

Opencourse for building quantum computer from TU-Delft

This course has two parts, [part 1](https://ocw.tudelft.nl/courses/building-blocks-quantum-computer-part-1/) for the layer -- qubits and [part 2](https://ocw.tudelft.nl/courses/building-blocks-quantum-computer-part-2/) for other layers to build and operate real quantum computer.

## Part I
